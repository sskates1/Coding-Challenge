<h2> Launch Academy  </h2>
<p>
	My primary goal in work is to constantly be creating useful programs and problem solving.
	I love to program because of that satisfying feeling you get from writing a program and watching
	it work as expected, and knowing that now that problem is solved. A bonus of this is that you 
	learn new techniques that help you solve other problems. My ideal job is to be coding and problem
	solving by creating new programs or tools on a daily basis. The flexibility of programming languages 
	allows one to be creative and solve problems in a unique way. And they enable automation, flexibility,
	and often a more general solution where many people who do not code only see a specific instance of a problem.
 </p>
 <p> 
	Launch Academy is a great way to enter the web development field to achieve this goal. I want to
	learn Ruby on Rails, meet people that are interested in software development, and be a part of a
	network that has connections to the software job market. In particular I would like to improve my
	coding style. While functional, it is not as eloquent as I would like it to be, since occasionally
	there are repeating chunks of code or a sub-optimal work flow.

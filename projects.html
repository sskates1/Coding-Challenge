<h2> Projects </h2>
<p>
<u>Georgia Tech Industrial Engineering Senior Design Project</u>
<br>
Worked with a team of seven to design and implement a process improvement and scheduling program for operating rooms for a local hospital with revenue in the hundreds of millions. I was responsible for programming the main portion of the project and leading meetings with hospital administration and faculty.
I built the GUI to display scheduling from bin packing algorithm and sequencing heuristic, with output sent to new excel file listing optimized schedule.
We performed analysis on 22,000 pieces of data to create a scheduling optimization program in order to save the hospital a potential of 500,000 dollars/year and create capacity for additional revenue streams.

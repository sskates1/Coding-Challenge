	I am a Database Manager at <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/">Massachusetts General 
	Hospital</a> working in the <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/ncri/">Neurological Clinical Research Institute</a>.
	My primary work is with the <a href="http://www.alsconsortium.org/index.php">Northeast 
	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Consortium</a> managing and improving data 
	collection in ALS clinical trials. I create and automate SQL logic checks to ensure 
	data quality and consistency to allow for statistical analysis. I also develop and design 
	Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) and train clinical research coordinators and site investigators
	on the use of the Electronic Data Capture system.
	<br>
	<br>
	I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012 with a B.S. in Industrial and
 	Systems Engineering. I studied simulation, optimization, supply chain modeling, 
 	stochastic manufacturing, regression, and forecasting. While at Georgia Tech I wrote a 
	program that improved scheduling for operating rooms for a local hospital as part of a senior <a href="projects.html">project</a>.
	</p>
	<p> In my spare time I enjoy surfing, rugby, and figure skating. I also enjoy board games and video games.</p>
